# Bellybutton Biodiversity Dashboard 

## Purpose 

Our client was interested in researching potential bacteria candidates for synthesizes proteins that taste like beef. We partnered with a beef startup company to discover and document different bacteria samples taken from volunteers' bellybuttons. 

As this information needed to be easily accessible to both the client and the volunteers, we created an interactive dashboard using ID numbers to distinguish between volunteers and show what bacterial species were prominent in each person. 

## Result 

The [final dashboard](https://msprech.github.io/belly_button_biodiversity/) not only presents each volunteer's top 10 bacteria cultures, but also their demographic information and how many times per week they wash their bellybutton. This information was portrayed through intuitive visualization, such as the washing frequency gauge and bubble chart pictured below.

## Summary 

Although this dashboard gives a lot of detailed information about individual volunteers, it is difficult from this page alone to get a sense of what bacterial cultures are relevant to the study. Further analysis should focus on grouping prevalence of different cultures and creating connections to taste and protein synthesis.
